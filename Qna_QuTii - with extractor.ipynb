            "2) How are the trends in surface passenger transport related to greenhouse gas emissions?\n",

            "2. According to Knowles (2006), what are the implications of increasing motorization for social inequality?\n",
            "- Increasing motorization has profound implications for social inequality as the ability to cover greater distances and access to motorized means of transport become crucial factors for social inclusion, social status, and quality of life. This means that those who have access to motorized means of transport have an advantage over those who do not, leading to a further divide in society.\n",

            "2. How does the concept of car dependence relate to the notion of path dependence?\n",
            "- The concept of car dependence, similar to the notion of path dependence, emphasizes the resistance encountered by policy measures aimed at reducing car use and ownership. Both concepts highlight the self-reinforcing dynamics and the positive feedback of motorization, which creates the preconditions for further motorization.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. According to Dennis and Urry, how has the automobile impacted space?\n",
