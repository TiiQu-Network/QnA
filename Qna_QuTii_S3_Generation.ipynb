      "Answer: The Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) system is a system that classifies hospital cases into identifiable groups in order to identify ‘products’ that a hospital provides. This model of classification is based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the presence of complications or co-morbidity. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. What countries has the DRG system spread to?\n",
      "Answer: The DRG system has spread to countries such as Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Russia; followed by a less rapid spread from acute care into long-term care and psychiatry.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What was the main aim of PbR?\n",
      "A1: The main aim of PbR was to improve efficiency and increase value for money in the NHS by enhancing service quality, facilitating patient choice, enabling service innovation, improving quality of service and reducing waiting times by rewarding healthcare providers for the volumes of work completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: When did the first NHS foundation trust move to the full PbR system?\n",
      "A2: The first NHS foundation trust applicants moved to the full PbR system in 2005–06.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. What does HRG stand for?\n",
      "A1. HRG stands for healthcare resource group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2. How often are HRGs reviewed?\n",
      "A2. HRGs are reviewed every four years to ensure accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q3. What is the aim of the payment by results scheme?\n",
      "A3. The aim of the payment by results scheme is to allow the commissioning of activity volumes, from a plurality of providers, on the basis of a standard, national pricing tariff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q4. What was the overarching aim of the CQUIN framework?\n",
      "A4. The overarching aim of the CQUIN framework was to promote non-price competition, such as provider differentiation on the basis of service quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What was the purpose of CQUIN payment framework?\n",
      "A1: The purpose of the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) payment framework was to help local commissioners identify and agree quality improvement schemes and enable them to reward excellence by linking a proportion of healthcare providers’ income to the achievement of local quality improvement goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: Why was CQUIN focused on VTE?\n",
      "A2: CQUIN was focused on VTE because there are large gaps in the provision of this key patient safety intervention, despite evidence-based guidelines recommending routine use of thromboprophylaxis for most hospitalised patients over 23 years prior.\n",
      "Q1: What is the name of the framework introduced to provide financial incentive to hospitals for focusing on VTE prevention?\n",
      "A1: The Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) framework was introduced to provide financial incentive for hospitals to focus on VTE prevention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: How many hospitalised patients die from preventable VTE each year?\n",
      "A2: The House of Commons Health Select Committee estimated that over 25,000 patients admitted to hospital die each year from preventable VTE.\n",

      "Q: What is the CQUIN payment framework?\n",
      "A: The CQUIN Payment Framework is an English healthcare system that links a proportion of providers’ income to the achievement of local quality improvement goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How does the CQUIN Payment Framework incentivize providers?\n",
      "A: The CQUIN Payment Framework incentivizes providers through rewards such as bonuses for meeting specific targets, as well as withholding a percentage of contract value for failure to report according to contractual obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. What is the estimated value of the CQUIN scheme for PCTs?\n",
      "A1. The financial value of a CQUIN scheme is specified nationally as a % of actual outturn value of the provider's contract. At the start of the year, the expected value of the scheme should be calculated as a % of the estimated total outturn contract value for commissioned patient services. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2. What motivates individuals working for PCTs to successfully implement local quality improvement goals when they have no personal benefit in terms of monetary reward?\n",
      "A2. Different types of motivation, such as intrinsic motivation, altruism, recognition, and professional pride, may act as either a barrier or facilitator to the successful implementation of the payment by results schemes in the wider NHS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. What does the ninth annual survey suggest about NHS staff?\n",
      "A1. The ninth annual survey indicates that 90% of NHS staff feel that their role makes a difference to patients and 87% are satisfied with the quality of care they personally give.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2. What were the revised NICE guidance in January 2010?\n",
      "A2. The revised NICE guidance in January 2010 formalised differing hospital guidelines for attributing VTE risk, administering appropriate prophylaxis and dealing with contraindications. This meant that compliance against a national target was now able to be monitored for every acute provider.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 1: What is the first variable that determines an employee's motivation to perform effectively?\n",
      "Answer: The first variable that determines an employee's motivation to perform effectively is the effort-reward probability. \n",
      "\n",
      "Question 2: How does the CQUIN framework work to bridge the gap between individual and organisational reward?\n",
      "Answer: The CQUIN framework works to bridge the gap between individual and organisational reward by creating and rewarding a culture of continuous quality improvement with stretching goals and measured outcomes agreed in contracts with PCTs on an annual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. What are P45 targets?\n",
      "A1. P45 targets are public service targets in health which have commonly become known as \"P45\" targets. If certain targets are not achieved, the job may be at risk. \n",

      "Descriptive Question 2: What motivated the decision to compare patients within General Medicine and Orthopaedics? \n",
      "Answer 2: The decision to compare patients within General Medicine and Orthopaedics was motivated by the hypothesis that a speciality with a relatively high proportion of planned admissions (orthopaedics) would find it easier to implement the revised guidance than a speciality with a relatively high proportion of unplanned admissions (general medicine).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: How many patient files were used to conduct the audit?\n",
      "A1: A sample of 408 patient files across all four hospitals were used to conduct the audit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: How did the statistical analysis help to prove that the admission data was not ‘cherry-picked’?\n",
      "A2: The statistical analysis helped to confirm that in those hospitals where the audit team was unable to take its own sample, a random cross section of files appeared to have been made available without having been manipulated by the hospital records departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: How many medical records were sampled in 2009?\n",
