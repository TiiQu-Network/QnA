      " What is payment by results (PbR) and how does it help the NHS?\n",
      "Answer: Payment by results (PbR) is a system introduced in England in the NHS Plan of July 2000. It links the allocation of hospital funds to the activity they undertake, providing incentive payments to hospitals. This system helps the NHS manage costs and incentivises hospitals to increase activity, which should ultimately lead to improved services for patient care. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. How is the system of Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) used?\n",
      "Answer: Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) are a system used to classify hospital cases into identifiable groups in order to identify ‘products’ that a hospital provides. The system is based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the presence of complications or co-morbidity. It has been adopted as the unit of payments to hospitals in many health systems, replacing ‘cost-based’ reimbursement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 1: What was the main aim of PbR?\n",
      "Answer 1: The main aim of PbR was to improve efficiency and increase value for money in the NHS by enhancing service quality, facilitating patient choice, enabling service innovation, improving quality of service and reducing waiting times by rewarding healthcare providers for the volumes of work completed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Question 2: When was the first NHS foundation trust applicants moved to the full PbR system?\n",
      "Answer 2: The first NHS foundation trust applicants moved to the full PbR system in 2005–06.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 1: How often are HRGs reviewed? \n",
      "Answer: HRGs are reviewed every four years. \n",
      "\n",
      "Question 2: What is the aim of the Payment by Results system?\n",
      "Answer: The goal of Payment by Results is to allow the commissioning of activity volumes that are required to deliver service priorities from a plurality of providers on the basis of a standard, national pricing tariff.\n",
      " Answer: The CQUIN payment framework, introduced nationally in 2009, enabled commissioners to reward excellence by linking a proportion of healthcare providers' income to the achievement of local quality improvement goals. The CQUIN payment framework focused on VTE because there continue to be large gaps in the provision of this key patient safety intervention, despite the first evidence-based guidelines being issued over 23 years prior. \n",
      "\n",
      "Descriptive Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What was the purpose of introducing the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) payment framework? \n",
      "A1: The CQUIN payment framework was introduced nationally in 2009 to help local commissioners identify and agree quality improvement schemes, and to enable them to reward excellence by linking a proportion of healthcare providers’ income to the achievement of local quality improvement goals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: Why did the CQUIN payment framework focus on VTE? \n",
      "A2: The CQUIN payment framework focused on VTE because\n",
      " How do hospitals reduce the risk of VTE in admitted patients?\n",
      "Answer: Hospitals can reduce the risk of VTE in admitted patients by assessing the risk of VTE on admission, and providing appropriate thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated. This is supported by the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation Payment Framework (CQUIN) for 2010-2011. \n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the estimated number of preventable deaths caused by VTE in hospital patients?\n",
      "Answer: The House of Commons Health Select Committee estimated that over 25,000 patients admitted to hospital die each year from preventable VTE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What is the CQUIN payment framework? \n",
      "A1: The CQUIN payment framework is a system which enables commissioners to reward excellence by linking a proportion of English healthcare providers’ income to the achievement of local quality improvement goals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: How is compliance with the CQUIN payment framework measured? \n",
      "A2: Compliance with the CQUIN payment framework is measured from a nationally mandated monthly Unify2 data collection for all providers of NHS acute services. Failure to report in line with such contractual obligations allows commissioners to withhold a percentage of contract value.\n",
      "\n",

      "Q2: How can addiction be reframed to improve strategies across different jurisdictions?\n",
      "A2: Addiction can be reframed in at least three ways to improve strategies across different jurisdictions, including recognition of a biological predisposition for seeking out drugs, replacing the term substance use disorder with 'heavy use over time', and implementing a quantitative risk assessment accounting for drug potency and drug exposure.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What is the evolutionary evidence for biological predisposition? \n",
      "A1: The evolutionary evidence for biological predisposition suggests that humans have been exposed to drugs since long before modern times and that plants produce numerous chemicals, such as tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, nicotine, and opiates, to deter consumption of plant tissue by animals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What is the role of natural selection in this evolutionary evidence? \n",
      "A2: Natural selection plays an important role in this evolutionary evidence, as it has selected for compounds that discourage consumption of the plant via punishment of potential consumers.

      "\n",
      "Q2. What implications does evolutionary evidence have on policies that prohibit drug use?\n",
      "A2. The evolutionary evidence has two implications: firstly, policies that prohibit the use of drugs are likely to fail because people have a biological predisposition to seek out chemicals with varying nutritional and pharmacological properties; and secondly, in present-day society, drug delivery systems have been developed that are beyond what is reflected in the natural environment, particularly with respect to levels of potency, availability and taste, which could be argued as being the more central drivers of harm.\n",

      "Q2. How is the MOE calculated?\n",
      "A2. MOEs are calculated as the ratio of a toxic dose of the drug (usually the benchmark dose BMDL10, the lowest dose which is 95% certain to cause no more than a 10% negative outcome incidence). The higher the MOE, the lower the level of risk, with low risk not implying safety. An MOE of 100 means that the drug is being consumed at one hundredth of the benchmark dose; an MOE of 1 means that the drug is being consumed at this toxic dose.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q2: What is the anticipated long-run scenario of the experiments with animal models? \n",
      "A2: The anticipated long-run scenario is that the experiments with animal models would find that inoculations with live virus would result in the efficient triggering of systemic infections with SARS-CoV-2 with less pulmonary distribution of the virus than the airway inoculation, and hopefully in faster resolution.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q2. Why is it important for governments to reduce delays due to risk-avoidance by firms?\n",
      "A2. It is important for governments to reduce delays due to risk-avoidance by firms to increase the probability of finding a viable vaccine candidate and accelerate its availability, thereby reducing the risk of vaccine failure.\n",
      " \n",
      "Q1: How can governments or other organizations address the market failure for products like COVID-19 vaccines?\n",
      "A1: Governments or other organizations can provide funding for the production and development of vaccines to overcome the firm-level costs and risks, as well as create incentives for buyers to purchase the product. \n",
      "Q2: What are the two types of market failures implicated in the development of COVID-19 vaccines?\n",
      "A2: The two types of market failures implicated in the development of COVID-19 vaccines are a buyer/seller mismatch, where producers are unaware of the market for their product, and a risk tolerance mismatch, where the socially optimal level of risk-taking is higher than that for individual firms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What incentives are needed to create high-risk projects?\n",

      "\n",
      "Question 2: How can governments and private philanthropists use prizes to incentivize innovation? \n",
      "Answer: Governments and private philanthropists can offer financial rewards for breakthroughs or solutions to a scientific problem through prizes. This approach incentivizes innovation and only pays out for successful solutions, while also not costing anything to those firms that do not reach their criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: How can the lack of financial incentive be addressed for smaller firms when it comes to developing a vaccine? \n",
      "A1: The probability of success needs to be high, the investment has to be nearly viable without a prize, or the size of the prize should make the investment an expected gain despite the risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What disadvantage is associated with using prizes to fund the development of a vaccine? \n",
      "A2: Unlike the alternatives, prizes cannot be used or borrowed against to fund the project since they are contingent upon success. Furthermore, their timing is also not ideal as speed is critical and decisions should be immediate and certain rather than contingent and post-success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. What drawbacks are associated with using government programs or public-private partnerships for high-risk approaches?\n",
      "A1. One drawback associated with using government programs or public-private partnerships for high-risk approaches is that they require government expertise, and necessitate selecting one or a few projects to focus on. This can lead to projects that are not funded being neglected, favouring well-connected and larger firms. These agreements are also complex, which can lead to regulatory capture and tend to take a long time to negotiate and implement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2. What are some alternatives to using government programs or public-private partnerships for high-risk approaches?\n",
      "A2. An alternative to using government programs or public-private partnerships for high-risk approaches is the “Apollo program” or “Manhattan Project” approach, where the government directly invests massively in projects. This approach may lead to a greater diversity of high-risk approaches, whereas government programs\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is an advance market commitment?\n",
      "A: An advance market commitment is a purchase order for a product that is contingent on successful development. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What drawbacks does the outside funder approach for vaccine development have?\n",
      "A1: The drawbacks of the outside funder approach for vaccine development include governments potentially having difficulty choosing which approaches to fund or waiting until funding is not necessary to jumpstart production early, difficult negotiations between funders and companies, and the potential for regulatory capture or windfall profits on the part of companies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: Why would it not be an effective approach for COVID-19 vaccine development?\n",
      "A2: An outside funder approach would not be an effective approach for COVID-19 vaccine development because it requires the government or other sponsor to commit to purchases of many still-unproven products, which would need to be contracted with many different companies. This would be highly wasteful because only a few of the vaccines would be needed.\n",
      " Put options are derivatives contracts that give the buyer the right\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. What is the push-pull approach proposed by Athey et al.?\n",
      "A1. The push-pull approach proposed by Athey et al. is a combination of direct investments (“push”) and precommitment to purchase the first resulting product to come to market (“pull”). \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2. What are the drawbacks of the push-pull approach?\n",
      "A2. The drawbacks of the push-pull approach are that the government funding for purchasing may be exhausted before it reaches market and that companies are left with the bulk of the risk from overproduction if they are not the first to market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 1: What is the right that the put option would give companies?\n",
      "Answer 1: The put option would give companies the right to sell a portion of their investment in vaccine production to the government.  \n",
      "Question 2: What would companies do if their vaccine product turns out to be non-viable?\n",
      "Answer 2: Companies would use the option to sell their vaccine product to the government if it turns out to be non-viable.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What is the proposed timeline for the production of the vaccine? \n",
      "A1: The proposed timeline is six months after the result is known. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What does the government put option provide for the company? \n",
      "A2: The government put option provides the company with the ability to recoup 90% of its eventual costs, capped at the company's initial project cost estimate, in exchange for the facility and equipment.\n",
      " This would require companies to agree to certain price, production, and availability targets in exchange for receiving the option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. How could pricing be used to modify the incentives of the put options?\n",
      "A1. The government could charge for the contracts instead of providing them for free. This would further dissuade unqualified or undercapitalized companies from taking huge immediate risks with small probabilities of success, and prices for such contracts would need to be a small fraction of the actuarially fair price, otherwise the scheme does not actually provide the needed incentives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2. What type of variant is unrelated to the options themselves?\n",
      "A2. The last of the variants, conditions on sales, is somewhat different since it is largely unrelated to the options themselves. This would require companies to agree to certain price, production, and availability targets in exchange for receiving the option.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What benefits do recipients of put options receive in exchange for participation?\n",
      "A1: Recipients of these options benefit from the program’s guarantee, in exchange for participation the government may claim priority for purchases, cap the profit margin on sales to the government, or cap the price paid by the government for a product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: How could governments prioritize domestic purchases of the vaccine?\n",
      "A2: Governments that took on risk to ensure investment in a product might also want to prioritize domestic purchases, rather than allowing them to be sold internationally. This can be addressed in similar ways, such as through international coalitions and agreements.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Question 1: What are the advantages of using put options to accelerate vaccine production?\n",
      "Answer 1: Advantages of this approach include allowing commercial companies to use traditional methods for financing and operating their businesses without unnecessary government supervision or contracting, providing incentives for starting production earlier, and having lower costs than direct investment to pay for high-risk products while preserving market incentives. \n",
      "\n",
      "Question 2: What market mechanisms are used to provide high-quality products in this approach?\n",
      "Answer 2: This approach preserves normal market mechanisms to provide high-quality products. Because the market is competitive, having an earlier and/or better product on the market will increase sales, and therefore profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What is the tradeoff between payment amounts and incentives for firms in option-based guarantees?\n",
      "A1: The tradeoff between payment amounts and incentives for firms in option-based guarantees is that a high payment amount can provide greater incentives for firms to accelerate production but may also result in a higher cost for the program. \n",
      "Q2: How could private funding that relies in part on the known risk reduction from the government guarantee be implemented quickly?\n",
      "A2: Private funding that relies in part on the known risk reduction from the government guarantee could be implemented more quickly than the alternatives since it does not require advance payments or contracts, and the calculation of the payment can be deferred, therefore avoiding the need for extensive and slow negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What is a potential political liability of an option-based guarantee program?\n",
      "A1: The program may appear wasteful because, perhaps counterintuitively, payments are only made for unused products and abandoned projects, which may make the program politically unpopular. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What political challenges may arise with an option-based guarantee program?\n",
      "A2: Unforeseen challenges may arise with the program, as similar programs have not been tried before. The program may appear wasteful, and it does not address pricing or local supply, so it does not guarantee that any viable vaccines would become widely available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. What are the four factors which could mitigate the political risk of option-based guarantees?\n",
      "A. First, the payment structure should help to minimise waste, giving less ammunition to opponents. Second, the program could be presented as evidence of government action to combat the pandemic, which is likely to be popular in the current climate. Third, the government could of course claim credit for any successful products emerging from the program. Fourth, additional mechanisms or clauses in the contract, such as the variants described above, could ensure that the products are sold at a reasonable price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. What are the contexts in which option-based guarantees are most useful?\n",
      "A. The optimal approach – or more likely, combination of approaches – to developing healthcare products will vary by disease, time period, and urgency. Option-based guarantees can be particularly useful in contexts where there are high levels of uncertainty or rapid changes in technology, such as during pandemics, or for diseases with\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What type of guarantees are potentially useful for funding vaccine trials?\n",
      "A1: Option-based guarantees may be useful for funding very costly Phase 2 and 3 trials, in which companies can be paid part of their costs if the product fails to gain approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What is the most appropriate type of guarantee for a low-risk vaccine?\n",
      "A2: Public-Private Partnership (PPP) or direct purchase orders are much more appropriate than option-based guarantees for low-risk vaccines.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What type of approach can mitigate the risk that a company will be slow to respond to anticipated but uncertain demand?\n",
      "A1: Athey et al.’s advance market commitments can be useful in this case as they can facilitate negotiations for price and quantity before the decision has been made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What are some examples of innovative solutions for low capital costs?\n",
      "A2: Prizes for successful innovation are a useful approach for creating incentives for investments, such as new types of point-of-care tests for active infection and new monitoring technologies.\n",

      "1. How does decision-making contribute to pandemic preparedness?2. How can the effectiveness of pandemic preparedness exercises be measured?Decision-making is a critical factor in the success of pandemic preparedness exercises.  Decision makers need to be knowledgeable about the different aspects of pandemics, have access to accurate data, and be able to make quick and informed decisions during a crisis. They also need to be able to take action to ensure certain capabilities are in place, such as stockpiles of PPE, vaccine development capabilities, scalable ICU capacity, and track and trace systems. The effectiveness of pandemic preparedness exercises can be measured by evaluating the preparedness of the country on a series of criteria such as the availability of PPE, vaccine development capacities, investment in R&D, and track and trace systems. This can be done both before and after the exercise is conducted to check the impact of the exercise.\n",
