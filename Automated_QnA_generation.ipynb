      "Q2: What techniques can be used to strengthen the estimation of health spending elasticities?\n",
      "A2: Techniques such as controlling for potential confounders (e.g. poverty, literacy rate), applying robust estimation strategies to account for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality and using an instrumental variable (IV) (i.e. a variable that has no direct impact on the health outcome but indirectly, through its impact on health expenditure) can be used to help strengthen the estimation of health spending elasticities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What is required to convert mortality data into QALYs or DALYs? \n",
      "A1: Converting mortality data into QALYs or DALYs requires additional assumptions which include data on the age and gender structure of the population as well as the morbidity burden of disease.\n",

      "A1: The five alternatives to GDP-based CETs for decision-makers faced with urgent resource allocation decisions are (1) providing universal access for a finite number of services, (2) targeting discretionary services to the neediest, (3) categorizing and allocating resources according to effectiveness, (4) using refined financial eligibility criteria, and (5) estimating a health opportunity cost CET using local data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What is the long-term solution for LMICs for resource allocation decisions?\n",
      "A2: The long-term solution for LMICs for resource allocation decisions is to estimate a health opportunity cost CET using local data, since it will explicitly link CETs to budget constraints and help articulate the trade-offs that inevitably arise in coverage decisions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q1: What are the four suggestions provided by LMICs to structure the conversation on value for money and affordability? \n",
      "A1: The four suggestions are: empirically estimated supply-side CETs using local data, deliberate processes that are as evidence-based as possible, setting thresholds that are not too high and considering the implications and risks of under-estimating the CET.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: What is the 1-3 times GDP per capita rule?\n",

      "\n",
      "Q2: What activity of Rrp44 has been previously reported to target the 5’ ETS region?\n",
      "A2: The activity of Rrp44 that has been previously reported to target the 5’ ETS region is its endonuclease activity.\n",

      "Question 2: What was the unexpected result seen in the data for Rrp44-endo?\n",
      "Answer 2: The unexpected result seen in the data for Rrp44-endo was the peak of short reads was apparently lost due to point mutations in the PIN domain active site.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1: What is the potential problem posed by the single-stranded RNA-binding pore in the process of RNA degradation by Rrp44?\n",
      "A1: The potential problem posed by the single-stranded RNA-binding pore is that it may slow or block the substrate RNA from being removed from the exosome channel, which is necessary for re-adenylation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Q2: How can substrate release be facilitated for re-adenylation? \n",
      "A2: Substrate release for re-adenylation may be facilitated by cleavage of the stalled substrate by the Rrp44 endonuclease activity, leading to a ~10 nt fragment remaining associated with the exonuclease domain, and release of the remainder of the substrate for further rounds of TRAMP-mediated tailing and degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Question 1: What changes have been observed in the exosome that may account for its endonuclease activity?\n",
      "Answer 1: Subsequent analyses of the exosome have indicated that the exosome can undergo conformational changes that potentially allow passage from the central channel to the endonuclease active site, which is supported by biochemical analyses that suggest the efficiency of the exosome's endonuclease activity is dependent on the central channel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Question 2: What is the difficulty in mapping ~10 nt RNA fragments to the yeast genome?\n",
      "Answer 2: The difficulty in mapping ~10 nt RNA fragments to the yeast genome is that the yeast genome is approximately 12.1 Mb, and therefore to be expected to identify a unique site in the yeast transcriptome, sequences must be greater than 12 nt. This creates significant problems with false positive results.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Q1. What is the purpose of prioritizing ambiguous reads?\n",
